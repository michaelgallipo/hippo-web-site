					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/duke01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						Michael grew up in Vermont before leaving New England to attend Duke
						University. He graduated with honors from Duke with a degree in
						Public Policy Studies. He spent much of his career as a portfolio
						manager for both mutual funds and banks and completed the courses
						for both the Chartered Financial Analyst and Chartered Market
						Technician designations. This background gives him a deeper
						understanding of the needs of businesses than many with just
						technical backgrounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Michael is now happily navigating the world of web design and
						development. He has experience both with full feature web
						applications as well as static sites. He also served as a teaching
						assisant for two cohorts at Actualize Coding Bootcamp and was a
						contract web engineer with Boston-based True Fit.
